## Creating Matrices

You can create matrices with the `matrix` function.
The first argument is a vector, and the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments specify the number of rows and columns, respectively. Note that, by default, the elements of the matrix are filled in by column.

```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1, 5, 3, 0), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
B <- matrix(c(1, 7, 2, 1, -3, -1), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
C <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

The identity matrices can be created using the `diag` function. 
This creates the 2 x 2 diagonal matrix.
```{r}
diag(2)
```
However, the `diag` function is one of the more surpsing functions in R; read the "Details" section of its documentation.
These all do different things:
```{r}
diag(3)
diag(nrow = 3)
diag(c(1, 2, 3))
diag(matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3))
```

You can also create matrices by using `cbind` to combine vectors by column,
```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(4, 5, 6)
cbind(a, b)
```
and `rbind` to combine vectors by row,
```{r}
rbind(a, b)
```
Note that `cbind` and `rbind` can take arbitrary number of arguments,
```{r}
c <- c(7, 8, 9)
rbind(a, b, c)
```


## Matrix Information

To find the dimensions of a matrix use `dim`, `ncol`, or `nrow`
```{r}
dim(B)
nrow(B)
ncol(B)
```

To extract an element from a matrix use brackets. 
This extracts the 1st row, 2nd column from A,
```{r}
A[1, 2]
```
This extracts the 2nd row, 1st column from A,
```{r}
A[2, 1]
```
If you leave column blank, it extracts the entire row,
```{r}
A[1, ]
```
If you leave row blank, it extracts the entire column,
```{r}
A[ , 1]
```
You can also extract multiple rows or columns,
```{r}
B[1, 2:3]
```

## Matrix Operations

The common operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `^` work elementwise. In particular, `*` is **not** matrix multiplication.
```{r}
A + C
A + 2
A - C
A - 2
A * C
A * 2
A / C
A / 2
A ^ C
A ^ 2
```

If you try to do operations with matrices that do not have comptible dimensions, you will get the following error.
```{r error = TRUE}
A + B
```


To transpose a matrix use the `t` function
```{r}
t(A)
t(B)
```

For matrix multiplication use the `%*%` operator
```{r}
A %*% C
t(C) %*% A
A %*% B
```

You can multiply a matrix by a vector, but it will treat the vector as a column vector.
```{r}
B %*% c(1, 2, 3)
c(1, 2) %*% B
```
but not,
```{r error = TRUE}
B %*% c(1, 2)
c(1, 2, 3) %*% B
```

Aside: To find help for a special function, quote its name after `?`. For example,
```{r eval = FALSE}
?"%*%"
```

To invert a matrix, use the `solve` function.
This will calculate $A^{-1}$,
```{r}
solve(A)
```
You cannot invert non-square matrices
```{r error = TRUE}
solve(B)
```

Note that you should avoid using *solve* if at all possible.
Inverting matrices is computationally expensive (about $O(n^3)$), and there are more efficient methods to invert matrices using knowledge of features of the matrix.
