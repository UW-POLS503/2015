- Use the search box in the *Help* tab of RStudio.

- Use the R functions: `?`, `help`, `apropos`. Use `help` to find what `apropos` does.

- [Rdocumentation.org](http://rdocumentation.org) searches the documentation of all R packages on CRAN and more

- Google has gotten better with R searches, but `R` (like other one-letter language names) is a particularly unfriendly search term.
  Use [rseek.org](http://rseek.org) intead; it is a specialized search restricted to sites already known to be related to R the statistical programming language

- [The Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com) and [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/) are organized by task and thus may be easier to find what you are looking for.

- Do you want to know what packages exist for a given topic? [CRAN Task Views](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) provide subject matter groupings of R packages.
  E.g. [Environmetrics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Environmetrics.html) and [Social Sciences](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SocialSciences.html)

- Want to find out what datasets are included in the R packages that you have installed? `data()`

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a question and answer website for computer programming questions. Search for questions about R using the "r" tag. You can do this by adding `[r]` to your search query. Other tags that may be useful are `[ggplot2]`, `[plyr]`. However, generally you shouldn't need to *ask* questions for this course. Someone has likely already asked your question before

- If you have a question about "statistics" rather than "R", then [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) is a Q-and-A site like Stack Overflow, but for statistics and machine learning.

- How to write a minimal repdroducible example http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example

- If you are going to ask for help, it is important to know how to ask for help
